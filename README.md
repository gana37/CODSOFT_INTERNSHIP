# TASK-01
MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines.

# TASK-02
CREDIT CARD FRAUD
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a
dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or
legitimate.

# TASK-03
CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-
based service or business. Use historical customer data, including
features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient
Boosting to predict churn.

# TASK-04
SPAM SMS DETECTION
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages

# TASK-05
HANDWRITTEN TEXT GENERATION
Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to
generate handwritten-like text. Train the model on a dataset of
handwritten text examples, and let it generate new text based on
the learned patterns.
